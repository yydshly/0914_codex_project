# create-vibe-motion

Scaffold a production-ready Remotion starter for procedural animation and programmatic video creation.

`create-vibe-motion` helps you bootstrap a ready-to-run Remotion project in seconds, so you can focus on building scenes instead of wiring tooling.

It is designed for creators and developers who want **procedural animation** workflows and want to **make video or motion graphics or animation programmatically**.

Use it when you need a practical starter for code-driven video production, animation templates, and iterative content generation.

## Usage

```bash
npm create vibe-motion@latest my-app
cd my-app
pnpm dev
```

To make the initial scaffold package download also use a mirror:

```bash
npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com npx create-vibe-motion@latest my-app
```

Dependencies are installed automatically after scaffolding with pnpm only.

If pnpm is missing, the scaffold first tries to install pnpm via npm, then continues with pnpm.

By default, dependency installation uses `https://registry.npmmirror.com`.
You can override it with `--registry=<url>` or `npm_config_registry`.

If no directory is provided, it creates `./vibe-motion-app` by default.

On macOS, install triggers a cached Chrome Headless Shell check/install for Remotion and stores it under:

`~/Library/Caches/com.zjucat.create-vive-motion/remotion`

### Options

- `--force`: overwrite files when the target directory is not empty.
- `--skip-install`: skip automatic dependency installation.
- `--registry`: specify the package registry used for pnpm/npm bootstrap install.

## Repository Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with two packages:

```
packages/
  create-vibe-motion/   # CLI package (published to npm, zero dependencies)
  template/             # Template files + dev environment (private, not published)
scripts/
  sync-template-to-cli.mjs   # copies template into CLI package before publish
```

### Where Template Content Comes From

- Files copied by the CLI are controlled by `packages/template/scaffold-manifest.json`.
- Generated `package.json`: `packages/template/scaffold-template-package.json`.
- Generated `.gitignore`: `packages/template/scaffold-template-gitignore`.

When adding or removing scaffold files, update `scaffold-manifest.json` first.

Template code is split into `motion/` for user animation code and `remotion/`
for the Remotion Studio/rendering support layer.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install              # install all dependencies
pnpm dev                  # run Remotion Studio
pnpm lint                 # lint template code
pnpm run sync-template    # sync template files into CLI package
pnpm run create:local     # test scaffold generation locally
```

### Validate a Generated App

```bash
pnpm run create:local -- /tmp/vibe-motion-test-app
cd /tmp/vibe-motion-test-app
pnpm dev
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# package dry-run (from CLI package)
cd packages/create-vibe-motion && pnpm pack --dry-run

# check published version
npm view create-vibe-motion version

# run scaffold CLI directly
node packages/create-vibe-motion/bin/create-vibe-motion.mjs my-app
```

## Release

```bash
pnpm release patch   # or minor / major
```

This script: bumps `packages/create-vibe-motion/package.json`, syncs the template, commits, tags, and pushes (`git push --follow-tags`). GitHub Actions then publishes to npm automatically.

## Security / Dependency Policy

- Avoid `pnpm audit fix` in template without manual verification.
- Prefer pinning known-good versions when upstream has temporary advisories.
- After dependency updates, always validate by generating a fresh app and running `pnpm install && pnpm audit`.

## Remotion Note

Remotion may render frames out of order and in parallel. Scene animation logic should be frame-deterministic and independently computable per frame.
