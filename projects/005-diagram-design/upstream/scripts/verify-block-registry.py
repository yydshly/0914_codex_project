"""Verify a Traceable block decomposition diagram's data-block-* metadata.

semantic-patterns.md § 8 requires every block to carry a stable, unique,
non-blank data-block-id, a non-blank data-block-name, and (when present) a
data-block-parent that resolves to another block's id in the same file, with
no cycles in the parent chain -- the same "no orphan blocks, no cycles" shape
Tree's own layout already assumes. Nothing in the SVG grammar enforces that
on its own: a copy-pasted node keeps its sibling's id, a renamed block leaves
its children pointing at an id that no longer exists, an empty id="" passes
as a real identifier, and all of them render as an ordinary,
unremarkable-looking diagram.

This does not correlate a block's metadata against its drawn position or
connector geometry -- see export-registry.md "What this never does". It is a
metadata-only structural check, not a visual layout check, and it is
independent of verify-geometry.py: that script catches a label mask clipped
by a node painted after it, this one catches a block registry that does not
cohere as a tree.

Parsing goes through the stdlib html.parser.HTMLParser rather than a regex,
so a block is recognized exactly when a browser would recognize its
data-block-* attributes: unquoted values, whitespace around `=`, and
case-insensitive attribute names all parse the same as their canonical form,
a comment's contents are never scanned as live markup (HTMLParser routes
`<!-- ... -->` to handle_comment, never to handle_starttag), and a repeated
attribute name keeps its first value, matching how a browser resolves a
duplicate attribute in one tag. A blank or boolean attribute (data-block-id
present with no value at all) still counts as the attribute being present --
with an empty string -- so it is reported as a blank id or blank name
finding rather than silently making the whole block invisible to the scan.
The prior regex scanner's quoted-`>` fix is superseded by this: a real regex
tag matcher cannot separate "not yet closed" from "attribute value contains
a literal `>`" for every valid quoting and spacing HTML allows, and each
such gap was the same failure shape -- a real block silently vanishing from
the scan, CI green as if the file had none.
